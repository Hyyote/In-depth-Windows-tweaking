This guide is meant to cover things beyond "advanced" PC optimization as I want to share my observations regarding hardware and software. Most known tweaks like basic BIOS and Windows settings are omitted. Most advanced tweaks can be found in my .bat files so I'm not going to explain them either, but leave everyone to test them on their own.

If you need components for games like Valorant or FACEIT and Windows Update support, this guide is not for you.

1. The Operating System
Linux isn't suitable for competitive gaming because tweaks don't go as deep as the ones you can do in Windows. Distros are similar in latency and input feel, which I found to be subpar compared to Windows.
I used to recommend Windows 7 and Windows 10 1803 specifically, but I have to admit that later versions are superior only because of perceived stability, higher performance and better software compatibility.
Windows 11 always used to feel smoother on the desktop but when I ran tests and played games, the two felt identical.
Windows 10 is more resilient when it comes to tweaks and it can be stripped down to its bones without sacrificing any functionality (16 services running), while Windows 11 needs UWP app support, S... (text truncated for brevity)
2. Windows Tweaks
Install a Version of Windows You Like

It can be a stock install or a custom one.
I recommend one that is pre-tweaked such as my NTLite builds or Tiny11.
Install Windows without Internet Connection

Ensure all update services and automatic driver updates are disabled.
Disable Audio Enhancements

In the sound control panel.
Import a Power Plan

My recommendations:
My own, idle disabled by default
Bitsum Highest Performance
Zoyata's power plan
Use AppxPackagesManager

Clean up apps you don't need.
Autoruns

Unhide Windows services.
Services to Disable

AppXSvc, ApxSvc, BITS, Bluetooth related, FontCache, UDK related, WMI, Wpn services.
Drivers to Disable

AppleSSD, Bluetooth related, HidBatt, HidBth, Intel Serial IO related, Microsoft_Bluetooth, WacomPen.
BCDEdit Commands
There are ongoing debates about which is the right configuration for each version of Windows, but in my experience, the legacy settings provided the best results:

Code
bcdedit /set nx AlwaysOff
bcdedit /set ems No
bcdedit /set bootems No
bcdedit /set integrityservices disable
bcdedit /set tpmbootentropy ForceDisable
bcdedit /set bootmenupolicy Legacy
bcdedit /set debug No
bcdedit /set disableelamdrivers Yes
bcdedit /set isolatedcontext No
bcdedit /set allowedinmemorysettings 0x0
bcdedit /set vm NO
bcdedit /set vsmlaunchtype Off
bcdedit /set configaccesspolicy Default
bcdedit /set MSI Default
bcdedit /set usephysicaldestination No
bcdedit /set usefirmwarepcisettings No
bcdedit /set sos no
bcdedit /set pae ForceDisable
bcdedit /set tscsyncpolicy legacy
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
bcdedit /set useplatformclock false
bcdedit /set useplatformtick no
bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes
bcdedit /set x2apicpolicy disable
bcdedit /set uselegacyapicmode yes
Device Manager

View → Devices by type
In Disk drives, uncheck "write caching" in Properties → Policies
Disable power saving on every device (use a script or manually)
Disable unnecessary devices: System Management BIOS, PCI Express Root Ports, ISA Bridge, PCI standard RAM Controller, generic software components, unused USB devices, generic PnP monitor
Show hidden devices, disable Motherboard resources
Task Manager

Disable Task Manager, use Process Explorer in portable mode.
SystemInformer (ProcessHacker) causes input lag.
Command:
Code
REG ADD "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v "DisableTaskMgr" /t Reg_DWORD /d "1" /f
