# In-depth-Windows-tweaking

This guide covers things beyond "advanced" PC optimization as I want to share my observations regarding hardware and software. Input lag and desync has plagued every area of gaming in the past few years and so far no one could identify a potential cause. Fortunately most of it can be mitigated by making sure your computer is perfectly set up without compromise.


1. The operating system (recommendation: 24H2/23H2)

Linux isn't suitable for competitive gaming because tweaks don't go as deep as the ones you can do in Windows. Distros are similar in latency and input feel, which I found to be subpar compared to any version of Windows.

I used to recommend Windows 7 and Windows 10 1803 specifically, but I have to admit that Windows 11 is superior only because of its gaming performance and software compatibility at the moment. There are ongoing debates about 23H2 vs 24H2 which I cannot settle, however trying the newer version first would make more sense.
